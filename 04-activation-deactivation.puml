The activate and deactivate keywords are used to show when a participant 
is active or inactive in the sequence diagram.

When a participant is activated, a thin vertical rectangle appears on their lifeline, indicating they are "processing" something.

When the participant is deactivated, the rectangle disappears, showing they are no longer active.

In practice useful when a function call, API request, or task is being processed by a participant.
