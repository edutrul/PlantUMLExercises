title User Search Flow – Lucidworks + Drupal Integration

🔁 Search Flow (User Query)

Scenario:
    1. User enters a search term in the Drupal frontend.
    2. The frontend sends the query to the Fusion Query Pipeline.
    4. The Pipeline fetches results from the Fusion Collection.
    5. Results are passed back through the Fusion Query Pipeline.
    6. The Fusion API returns search results to the Drupal frontend.
    7. The frontend displays results to the User.

Requirements:
    • Use actor for User.
    • Use participant for Drupal Frontend, Fusion Query Pipeline, and Fusion Collection.
    • Use `as` alias names for cleaner syntax (e.g., DF for Drupal Frontend).
    • Use solid arrows for requests and dotted arrows for responses.
    • Optionally, use activation/deactivation to show processing time.
    • Add notes for clarity (e.g., faceting, filtering logic).

note over FusionQueryPipeline
  Applies search logic:
  • Filters irrelevant results
  • Ranks by relevance
  • Boosts based on business rules
  • Handles other search optimizations
end note
activate FusionQueryPipeline
FusionQueryPipeline -> FusionCollection: Fetch results
FusionCollection --> FusionQueryPipeline: Return matching results
deactivate FusionQueryPipeline
FusionQueryPipeline --> DrupalFrontend: Return matching results
